  abstract={With the rapid deployment of LTE/5G services, mobile subscribers now have access to high-speed services approaching Gbps. However, most mobile data plans have data quota from a few GBs up, beyond which the subscriber will be restricted to much lower bandwidth (e.g., 1 Mbps) – rate-limited service. Rate limiting not only poses a significant challenge to service providers, as it is often mistaken for network problems, triggering false alarms at the providers, but may also cause significant performance anomalies at the application layer and transport layer. This work tackles two central problems in mobile network rate-limiting, namely rate-limiting classification and parameter estimation, through a novel model-based online rate-limiter (MODRL) detector that can detect the presence of rate limiting and estimate its parameters passively from transport layer ACK. Experiments in controlled network testbed and production 4G/5G mobile networks show that MODRL can achieve remarkably high and consistent classification accuracy across a wide range of networks. Preliminary results from integrating MODRL into adaptive video streaming and QUIC transport demonstrate that it can effectively eliminate the perfor- mance anomalies caused by rate limiting, and open new avenues to further optimize protocol performance over rate-limited mobile networks.},

  title={mBBR - Improving BBR Performance Over Rate-Limited Mobile Networks},
  author={Zhu, Shengtong and Liu, Yan and Guo, Lingfeng and Ngan, Rudolf K. H. and Lee, Jack Y. B.},
  abstract={In spite of the advances in mobile networks, most mobile data plans impose a fixed monthly data quota, beyond which the attainable bandwidth is explicitly limited to a much lower data rate. This rate-limited behavior could degrade TCP performances significantly, as confirmed by a major service provider who observed strong correlation between high packet loss rate and mobile rate limiting. The high packet loss translates directly into increased bandwidth cost which is significant in a large-scale service. This work investigates this problem in two steps. First, we establish the link between the high loss rate observed and mobile network rate limiting through experiments in both controlled testbed and production mobile networks. The results revealed that packet loss can and does increase dramatically in rate-limited mobile networks. This affects both TCP Cubic and BBR, the two most widely deployed TCP implementations. BBR, in particular, was impacted far more significantly, resulting in packet loss rates exceeding 40% in some cases. Second, we analyzed BBR’s operations under rate limiting to uncover the causes and developed new mechanisms - mBBR, to improve its performance. Experimental results show that mBBR can reduce BBR’s packet loss rate by up to 88%, thereby saving substantial bandwidth costs incurred in retransmitting lost packets when the user is under rate limiting.},
