I received my PhD from the [Department of Information Engineering](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2025, advised by [Prof. Jack Y.B. Lee](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~jacklee/).

My research focuses on **network transport protocols** and **video streaming optimization**, with a particular emphasis on TCP performance in mobile networks. I work on problems at the intersection of protocol design, measurement, and machine learning — building systems that improve real-world network performance at scale.

Recent highlights:
- **R-TCP** accepted at **NSDI '26** — a framework that reduces excessive TCP retransmissions under rate-limiting by up to 88%.
- Deployed **BBR-E2E** in production at a major short-video platform, improving rebuffering metrics across trillions of video sessions in a country-scale A/B test (ICNP '24).
- Published in **IEEE TMC** on rate-limiting detection (MODRL) and adaptive bitrate streaming for short videos.
