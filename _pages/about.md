I received my PhD from the [Department of Information Engineering](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2025, advised by [Prof. Jack Y.B. Lee](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~jacklee/).

My research focuses on **network transport protocols** and **video streaming optimization**, with a particular emphasis on TCP performance in mobile networks. I work on problems at the intersection of protocol design, measurement, and machine learning — building systems that improve real-world network performance at scale.
